Welcome to the Endian CTF!
You need to find both the little endian and big endian representations of a word.
If you get both correct, you will receive the flag.
Word: qqwtb
Enter the Little Endian representation: 6274777171
Correct Little Endian representation!
Enter the Big Endian representation: 7171777462
Correct Big Endian representation!
Congratulations! You found both endian representations correctly!
Your Flag is: picoCTF{3ndi4n_sw4p_su33ess_cfe38ef0}


This challenge is based of hex conversions and endian forms . SO what is an endian ?
In computing, endianness is the order in which bytes within a word of digital data are transmitted over a data communication medium or addressed (by rising addresses) in computer memory, counting only byte significance compared to earliness. Endianness is primarily expressed as big-endian (BE) or little-endian (LE)


-CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION
This is a challenge that we are working with . First lets launch the instance and see how things work here

challenge
So we are asked to find the endian form of the given word . To find the little and big endian we need to first reverse this string and then convert it into HEX form . To do this lets use one of the great tool that is CYBERCHEF

From the above operations we need to add two operations that are :
1 → Reverse
2 → To HEX
3 → In the HEX tool choose the Delimiter as none

This gives me the little endian format
The little endian format for my string qqwtb is 6274777171

Now to convert this into Big endian we just need to reverse the HEX format
SO , Reversing the Little endian gives us the Big endian format

6274777171 — — -> 7171777462

7171777462 — → This reversed string is our big endian . Giving this input in the terminal gives our flag

Big Enddian Calculation:

Your input:
6274777171

Convert to Big Endian:
Split into bytes:
62 74 77 71 71

Reverse:
71 71 77 74 62

Join back:
7171777462

✅ Big Endian String (hex): 7171777462
