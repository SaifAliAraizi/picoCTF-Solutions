The first thing I did when I saw this PDF was to open it in a Hex Editor. You can use any hex editor you want, but I used HexEd.it.

Press enter or click to view image in full size

HexEd.it view of flag2of2-final.pdf
Immediately, we can see that the first few bytes say PNG, this is the PNG file header. This tells us that our PDF file is actually a PNG file. You can read more about PNG file headers here.

So, when we rename this flag2of2-final.png, we get the first half of the flag: “ppicoCTF{f1u3n7_”.


First half of the flag
Combine this with the second half in the original pdf: “1n_pn9_&_pdf_7f9bccd1}, we get our full flag: ppicoCTF{f1u3n7_1n_pn9_&_pdf_7f9bccd1}
