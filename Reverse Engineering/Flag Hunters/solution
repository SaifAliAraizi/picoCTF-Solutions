The secret_intro is the verse that contains our flag:
secret_intro = \
'''Pico warriors rising, puzzles laid bare,
Solving each challenge with precision and flair.
With unity and skill, flags we deliver,
The ether's ours to conquer, '''\
+ flag + '\n'
In the code, we see that the secret_intro verse is added to the top of the song_flag_hunter.
song_flag_hunters = secret_intro +\
However, the reader starts reading from [VERSE1]:
reader(song_flag_hunters, '[VERSE1]')
We need to find a way to make the reader start from the very first line.
Solution
We know that the script takes user input, and this input isn’t sanitized:

elif re.match(r"CROWD.*", line):
        crowd = input('Crowd: ')
        song_lines[lip] = 'Crowd: ' + crowd
        lip += 1
We also know that we can use the RETURN command to force the reader to read any specific line:

elif re.match(r"RETURN [0-9]+", line):
        lip = int(line.split()[1])
Since we know that the verse containing our flag starts at the very beginning, we need to pass RETURN 0 to the script. However, if we do this, the script will simply echo RETURN 0 back to us, treating it as a string. To make sure the script interprets RETURN 0 as a command rather than a string, we need to adjust our input slightly.

Instead of just using RETURN 0, we will use "some_string;RETURN 0"

Command line wizards, we’re starting it right,
Spawning shells in the terminal, hacking all night.
Scripts and searches, grep through the void,
Every keystroke, we're a cypher's envoy.
Brute force the lock or craft that regex,
Flag on the horizon, what challenge is next?

We’re flag hunters in the ether, lighting up the grid,
No puzzle too dark, no challenge too hid.
With every exploit we trigger, every byte we decrypt,
We’re chasing that victory, and we’ll never quit.

Echoes in memory, packets in trace,
Digging through the remnants to uncover with haste.
Hex and headers, carving out clues,
Resurrect the hidden, it's forensics we choose.
Disk dumps and packet dumps, follow the trail,
Buried deep in the noise, but we will prevail.
